# Blue-vs-Red

Blue-vs-Red is a simple and attractive game. The main goal of the game is that players must collect all the coins and reach the end point of the stage. But when they collide with red objects, the game ends.

The number of losses and the time it takes to complete each stage are saved

And you can measure your skill level compared to other players

According to this description, the Blue-vs-Red game is based on collecting coins, number of losses, time elapsed, avoiding collision with red objects and reaching the end point.
